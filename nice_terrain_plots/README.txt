To make the images you will need to install the Matlab Image Processing toolbox, and retrieve the two datasets from the links provided below. The datasets need to be placed in the folder named 'data' before the script can be run.  
The first time the script is run after startup, it needs to read the datasets - this can take a little while. After that, it should be faster. 
The elevation model and texture model only agree to within a few kilometers - some tuning of the correction parameters may be required, if you want to render the landscape "up close"
