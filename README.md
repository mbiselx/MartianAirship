# MartianAirship
## Matlab & Fortran code for Martian Airship Semester Project

This is the code used in my Fall 2021 EPFL Space Technologies Minor Semester project "Martian Airship Feasibility Study - Navigation and Data Handling"

Only the code is contained in this repository - the data has not been included. However, links to the original data can be found in the README of the '00_data' folder.
